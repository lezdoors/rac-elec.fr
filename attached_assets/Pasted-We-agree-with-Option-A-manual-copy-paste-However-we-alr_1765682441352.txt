We agree with Option A (manual copy/paste).

However, we already located the chatbot files in the source project elec-vercel-raccordement.
So instead of guessing “ChatWidget.tsx”, we will transfer the chatbot using this exact set.

Source files we will copy from elec-vercel-raccordement

Frontend
	•	client/src/components/chatbot.tsx
	•	attached_assets/src/components/ChatInput.tsx
	•	attached_assets/src/components/ChatHeader.tsx
	•	attached_assets/src/components/ChatMessages.tsx
	•	client/src/components/admin/chatbot-contact-card.tsx (if used)
	•	client/src/components/admin/chatbot-contact-notification.tsx (if used)
	•	client/src/components/ui/chart.tsx (confirm whether this one is imported vs the attached_assets one)
	•	public/chatbot-loader.js (confirm if required for mounting)

Backend
	•	server/routes/chatbot.ts
	•	server/routes/chatbot-backup.ts (only if referenced)
	•	server/chatbot-notification.ts (only if referenced)
	•	server/chatbot-email-service.ts (only if referenced)

DB
	•	migrations/add-chatbot-fields.ts (only if the chatbot persists leads/history in DB)

Rules (strict)
	1.	Do not rename components. Keep file names + exports exactly the same unless there is a hard conflict.
	2.	Do not “isolate CSS” or change styling. We want identical behavior first.
	3.	Wire only what is required: add new files + register routes + mount widget.
	4.	Do not touch any existing form/CRM logic.

Your job
	1.	Tell us the exact destination paths in THIS repo for each file above.
	2.	Tell us exactly what order you want the pastes in (front first vs backend first).
	3.	After we paste files, you will:
	•	Register routes in server/routes.ts
	•	Confirm the API path used by the frontend (ex /api/chatbot or /api/chat)
	•	List required env var names (no values)
	•	Validate end-to-end (send/receive message)

First action

Before we paste anything, please confirm:
	•	Which chart.tsx is actually imported by client/src/components/chatbot.tsx (the UI one or attached_assets one)
	•	Whether public/chatbot-loader.js is required or the chatbot is mounted purely via React component inclusion
	•	Whether the backend route is /api/chat or a different endpoint

Once you confirm, we will paste the frontend code first.

Why this matters

Your previous answer said “no migrations / no assets unless needed”, but our source project does include:
	•	loader
	•	migrations
	•	notification + email services

We need you to confirm what is actually used vs dead code so we port correctly.
