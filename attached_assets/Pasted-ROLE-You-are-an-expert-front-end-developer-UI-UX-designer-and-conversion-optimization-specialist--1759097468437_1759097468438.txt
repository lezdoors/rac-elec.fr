SPECIFIC TASKS
	1.	CTA Button Upgrade
	•	Refactor CSS for the main CTA.

	•	Ensure sticky CTA on mobile for maximum conversions.
	2.	Illustrations & Icons
	•	Replace outdated visuals with modern, lightweight SVG illustrations.

	•	Ensure illustrations load fast and don’t cause CLS shifts.
	3.	Testimonial & Performance Section
	•	Redesign HTML + CSS layout for testimonials and stats (e.g., dossiers traités, délai, support téléphonique).
	•	Options: horizontal scroll carousel on mobile, or 3-column grid on desktop.
	•	Add authoritative styling (e.g., star icons, client initials/photos, badges for “avis vérifiés”).
	•	Make performance stats visually punchy with large numbers + subtle animation.
	4.	Global Styling Overhaul
	•	Introduce a modern font (Poppins or Lato).
	•	Define a consistent color palette (base brand blue/green + 1 accent for CTA).
	•	Apply better spacing & padding across sections for readability.
	•	Ensure typography hierarchy: larger H1/H2, clear body text, consistent button styles.
	•	Guarantee mobile-first responsiveness: grid → stacked layout, touch-friendly targets.
	5.	Code Delivery
	•	Provide updated HTML + CSS snippets for each section.
	•	Clearly comment the code so it can be copy-pasted directly into existing site files.
