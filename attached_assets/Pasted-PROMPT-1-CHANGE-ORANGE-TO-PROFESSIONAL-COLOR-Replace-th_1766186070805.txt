PROMPT 1: CHANGE ORANGE TO PROFESSIONAL COLOR
Replace the orange color (#FF5722 or similar) throughout the site with a professional color scheme:

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Orange CTA buttons ("Démarrer ma demande", "Commencer maintenant", etc.)
- Orange feels too aggressive and doesn't convey trust/professionalism

CHOOSE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS:

OPTION A - PROFESSIONAL BLUE (RECOMMENDED):
- Primary CTA buttons: #2563EB (strong blue)
- Hover state: #1D4ED8 (darker blue)
- Gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #3B82F6 0%, #2563EB 100%)
- Shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.25)

OPTION B - TRUST-BUILDING DARK PURPLE:
- Primary CTA buttons: #7C3AED (vibrant purple)
- Hover state: #6D28D9 (darker purple)
- Gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B5CF6 0%, #7C3AED 100%)
- Shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.25)

APPLY NEW COLOR TO:
1. All "Démarrer ma demande" buttons
2. "Commencer maintenant" button
3. Any other orange CTAs
4. Keep hover effects: transform: translateY(-2px) + increased shadow

KEEP:
- "Nous contacter" secondary button as blue outline (don't change)
- Green checkmarks for trust badges
- Blue numbered circles (1, 2, 3, 4) in process steps

Replace ALL orange colors with your chosen option throughout the entire site.

🔧 PROMPT 2: COMPRESS SERVICE CARDS SECTION
Fix "Tous les Types de Raccordement Électrique Enedis" section - cards are too bulky and waste space:

CURRENT PROBLEMS:
- Cards take too much vertical space (huge padding)
- Icons are too large
- Excessive white space between elements
- Section feels bloated on mobile

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. CARD SPACING:
   - Reduce padding: 20px (currently appears to be 32px+)
   - Reduce margin between cards: 12px (currently appears to be 24px+)
   - Tighten spacing between icon and heading: 12px
   - Tighten spacing between heading and description: 8px
   - Tighten spacing between description and link: 12px

2. ICON SIZE:
   - Reduce from current size to 48px (currently appears to be 60-80px)
   - Keep icons centered

3. TYPOGRAPHY:
   - Heading: Keep at 20px but reduce margin-bottom to 8px
   - Description: 15px (reduce from 16px), line-height: 1.5 (reduce from 1.6)
   - Link: Keep at 16px

4. OVERALL CARD HEIGHT:
   - Target: Each card should be approximately 180-200px tall (currently ~250-280px)
   - Remove excessive padding top and bottom

5. DESKTOP LAYOUT:
   - When screen ≥768px, display cards in 3-column grid (side by side)
   - Max 2 rows if you have 6 cards
   - This will make the section 50% shorter on desktop

Apply these compression changes to make the section more compact and professional.

🔧 PROMPT 3: COMPRESS ASSISTANCE SECTION
Fix "Assistance pour Votre Demande de Raccordement Enedis" section - cards are too spread out and bulky:

CURRENT PROBLEMS:
- 4 contact cards stacked vertically taking massive space
- Each card has excessive padding and spacing
- Icons are too large
- Feels like it goes on forever on mobile

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. LAYOUT TRANSFORMATION:
   - Desktop (≥768px): Display in 2x2 grid (2 columns, 2 rows) - this will cut height in HALF
   - Mobile (<768px): Keep 2x2 grid but smaller cards with tighter spacing

2. CARD SIZING:
   - Reduce padding: 16px (currently appears to be 24-32px)
   - Reduce card height: Target ~120px per card (currently ~160-180px)
   - Gap between cards: 12px

3. ICON SIZE:
   - Reduce from current to 40px (currently appears to be 56-64px)
   - Remove or reduce icon background circle size

4. TYPOGRAPHY:
   - Heading: 18px, bold (reduce from current size)
   - Remove or minimize any subtitle text below heading
   - Tighten all spacing

5. SPACING BETWEEN ICON AND TEXT:
   - Reduce to 8px (currently appears to be 12-16px)

6. SECTION HEADER:
   - "Assistance pour Votre Demande de Raccordement Enedis" - reduce font size to 28px mobile / 32px desktop
   - "Nous sommes à votre écoute" - reduce to 16px
   - Reduce margin-bottom to 24px (currently ~40px)

This should compress the section from taking up 2+ screens to taking up less than 1 screen on mobile.

🎨 PROMPT 4: ADD DESKTOP GRID LAYOUTS
Transform mobile-stacked sections into desktop grids to dramatically reduce page length:

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- All cards are stacked vertically even on desktop
- Page is extremely long on desktop
- Wasted horizontal space

IMPLEMENT DESKTOP GRIDS:

1. "TOUS LES TYPES" SECTION (6 service cards):
   Desktop (≥992px):
   - 3 columns grid
   - 2 rows (if 6 cards)
   - Grid gap: 24px
   - Cards equal height
   
   Tablet (768px-991px):
   - 2 columns grid
   - 3 rows
   - Grid gap: 16px
   
   Mobile (<768px):
   - 1 column (current)
   - Gap: 12px

2. "ASSISTANCE" SECTION (4 contact cards):
   Desktop (≥768px):
   - 2x2 grid (2 columns, 2 rows)
   - Grid gap: 16px
   - Equal height cards
   
   Mobile (<768px):
   - 2x2 grid (keep, but tighter)
   - Gap: 12px

3. CSS IMPLEMENTATION:
   Use CSS Grid:
@media (min-width: 768px) {
.assistance-grid {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
gap: 16px;
}
}
@media (min-width: 992px) {
.service-types-grid {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
gap: 24px;
}
}

This will reduce overall page length by 40-50% on desktop while keeping mobile experience intact.

🎨 PROMPT 5: OVERALL SPACING OPTIMIZATION
Optimize vertical spacing throughout the site to reduce excessive scrolling:

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Massive gaps between sections
- Too much padding within sections
- Page feels unnecessarily long

IMPLEMENT TIGHTER SPACING:

1. SECTION PADDING:
   Desktop:
   - Section padding-top: 48px (reduce from 64-80px)
   - Section padding-bottom: 48px
   
   Mobile:
   - Section padding-top: 32px (reduce from 48px)
   - Section padding-bottom: 32px

2. HEADING MARGINS:
   - Section headings margin-bottom: 24px desktop / 20px mobile (reduce from 32-48px)
   - Subtitle margin-bottom: 16px (reduce from 24px)

3. PROCESS STEPS SECTIONS:
   - "Traitement des Demandes" section: Reduce spacing between numbered steps
   - "4 Étapes Simples" section: Reduce spacing between steps to 16px
   - Step number to content: 12px gap

4. TRUST BADGES ROW:
   - Below hero: Reduce padding to 16px top/bottom (currently ~24-32px)
   - Reduce spacing between badges

5. REMOVE EXCESSIVE MARGINS:
   - Between section heading and content: 24px max
   - Between cards in vertical stack: 12px max
   - Between icon and text in cards: 8-12px max

TARGET: Reduce total page scroll length by 30% without making it feel cramped.

📋 IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
Use these 5 prompts in sequence:

✅ Prompt 1 - Change orange to blue/purple (instant visual upgrade)
✅ Prompt 4 - Add desktop grid layouts (biggest space saving)
✅ Prompt 2 - Compress service cards section (reduce bulk)
✅ Prompt 3 - Compress assistance section (reduce bulk)
✅ Prompt 5 - Overall spacing optimization (final polish)

After implementation, you should see:

Professional blue/purple CTAs instead of aggressive orange
Desktop shows 3-column grid for services (instead of vertical stack)
Desktop shows 2x2 grid for assistance (instead of 4 vertical cards)
Page length reduced by 40-50% on desktop
Tighter, more professional spacing throughout
Mobile remains functional but more compact

Color recommendation: Go with Option A - Professional Blue (#2563EB) as it better conveys trust and authority for an electrical service, and it's already used in your numbered circles and links.
