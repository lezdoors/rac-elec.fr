Good diagnosis! Now let's fix the issues you identified.

PRIORITY ORDER:

Priority 1: Fix Dual Loading (CRITICAL)
You found GTM AND direct gtag.js both loading GA4 - this is the problem.

Decision needed:
- EITHER use GTM to manage GA4
- OR use direct gtag.js
- NEVER both at the same time

Recommendation: Use GTM ONLY
- Remove direct gtag.js (line 306)
- Let GTM handle GA4 via config tag
- Cleaner, more manageable

Action:
1. Remove or comment out direct gtag.js script (line 306)
2. Verify GTM has GA4 Configuration tag
3. Verify GA4 config tag has:
   - Measurement ID: G-D92SQT9L1P
   - Trigger: All Pages
   - send_page_view: true

Priority 2: Verify GA4 Measurement ID
Check if G-D92SQT9L1P is the correct stream for demande-raccordement.fr

In GA4 Admin:
- Data Streams → Web
- Find demande-raccordement.fr stream
- Confirm Measurement ID matches G-D92SQT9L1P

If wrong:
- Update to correct ID in both GTM and code

Priority 3: Test CSP Blocking
Check browser console for:
- CSP errors blocking googletagmanager.com
- CSP errors blocking google-analytics.com
- Network requests failing with CSP errors

If blocked:
- Update CSP headers to allow analytics domains

Priority 4: Verify GTM Tag Configuration
In GTM container GTM-K597C4C2:
- GA4 Configuration tag should:
  - Type: Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration
  - Measurement ID: G-D92SQT9L1P
  - Trigger: All Pages (not some pages, not pageview)
  - No blocking triggers
  - send_page_view: true (or not set, defaults to true)

TESTING PLAN:

After fixes:
1. Open site in Incognito
2. Open browser console
3. Navigate through 3-4 pages
4. Check console for:
   - No CSP errors
   - No "gtag is not defined" errors
   - Network tab shows requests to google-analytics.com/g/collect
5. Open GA4 → Realtime
   - Should show 1 active user immediately
   - Should show page_view events for each page

Do NOT add:
- SPA routing logic
- History listeners
- Manual page_view triggers
- Route change handlers

These are not needed for multi-page sites.

Implement Priority 1 (remove dual loading) first, then test.
Show me what you remove/change.
