Your task is to improve the design, clean the structure, and adjust the typography while keeping the site professional and administrative.

Do not modify any logic (Stripe, Supabase, form, routing).
This task is purely UI/UX.

⸻

1. Fix the section below the hero (“double hero” issue)

The current layout creates the impression of two hero sections, which breaks the visual hierarchy.

You must:

A. Remove the “double hero” feel

The section right under the hero should NOT look like another hero.

B. Move the illustration (“woman filling the form”)

Place the illustration on the LEFT side.

C. Move the text to the RIGHT side

Text block includes:
	•	H2 title
	•	Paragraph
	•	CTA button (“Start my request” / “Démarrer ma demande”)

D. Reduce vertical spacing

This section should look informational, not like a hero banner.

E. Typography adjustments
	•	H2 should be smaller than the main hero H1
	•	Paragraph spacing should be tighter
	•	Maintain an administrative/government-style simplicity

Section outcome

Left → illustration
Right → structured information block
Background should be white or very light gray — not hero-style.

2. Replace the last “Why trust us?” section above the footer

Currently, you have duplicate trust sections.
Remove the last one (the one just above the footer).

Replace it with a professional FAQ section

Add a clean FAQ with 6–8 questions.
Here are the questions to use:
	1.	What documents are required for a connection request?
	2.	What is the typical processing time for a dossier?
	3.	Do you handle temporary connection requests for construction sites?
	4.	Does your service include submitting the dossier to Enedis?
	5.	Can I track the progress of my request?
	6.	Are connection costs included in your service?
	7.	Is online payment secure?
	8.	How can I contact your support team?

FAQ formatting:
	•	Use collapsible accordion components or simple Q&A blocks
	•	No emojis
	•	Clean, professional typography
	•	Spacing consistent with the rest of the website

3. Typography and visual hierarchy improvements

Apply the following:

A. Use one consistent font system

Preferably Inter, Nunito Sans, or your existing administrative font.

B. Heading hierarchy
	•	H1: largest, bold (700)
	•	H2: slightly smaller, medium weight (600)
	•	H3: regular (500–600)

C. Paragraphs
	•	Increase line-height for readability
	•	Reduce oversized paragraphs
	•	Consistent text size across sections

D. Buttons
	•	Use ONE visual style for all CTA buttons
	•	Ensure padding and border-radius are consistent

E. Section spacing

Use consistent padding:
	•	Desktop: ~80px vertical
	•	Tablet: ~48px
	•	Mobile: ~32px

4. Illustration consistency

You must:
	•	Keep the current illustration style
	•	Ensure all illustrations have similar visual size and alignment
	•	No animations
	•	No emojis
	•	Maintain a professional, administrative style

⸻

5. Do NOT change any functional logic

Do not modify:
	•	Form steps
	•	Stripe checkout or configuration
	•	Supabase logic
	•	Event tracking
	•	Routing
	•	Submission process

This task is limited to layout, styling, spacing, and homepage structure.

6. Final checks

After making the updates, verify that:
	1.	The homepage flow is structured as:
Hero → Informational section → Process steps → Connection types → FAQ → Footer
	2.	There is no second hero section.
	3.	Illustration placements are clean and consistent.
	4.	Typography hierarchy is correct and professional.
	5.	No emojis appear anywhere.
	6.	The CTA “Démarrer ma demande” remains clearly visible and consistent across sections.
