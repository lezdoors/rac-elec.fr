1. Scope & Constraints
	1.	Work ONLY on the main landing page (Accueil) for demande-raccordement.fr.
	•	Update React/Next/Vite page and any related layout or component files that render:
	•	Hero
	•	“Commencez votre demande” section under hero
	•	4-step process section
	•	“Votre Demande de Raccordement” service cards
	•	FAQ section
	•	“Assistance pour votre demande…” section
	•	Purple CTA block and footer
	2.	Do NOT touch:
	•	Google Tag Manager / GA4 / conversion tags
	•	Forms logic, Supabase, API calls, routing
	•	Meta tags, structured data, canonical tags
	3.	If the project uses Tailwind, keep using Tailwind.
If it uses CSS modules / styled-components, keep the current system. Do NOT introduce a new CSS framework.
	4.	Keep the existing content and structure; we are only improving:
	•	Spacing
	•	Typography scale
	•	Illustration sizing & consistency
	•	Card styles
	•	Separators between sections

2. Design System to Implement

2.1 Spacing Scale

Implement/align all sections to this spacing system (use nearest equivalents in the existing system):
	•	XS = 8px
	•	S = 16px
	•	M = 24px
	•	L = 40px
	•	XL = 64px
	•	XXL = 96px

Rules:
	•	Vertical space between major sections ≈ 96px
	•	Hero top padding ≈ 120px, bottom padding 96px
	•	Inside section (title → subtitle, subtitle → content) ≈ 24px
	•	Gaps between cards/columns ≈ 40px

Normalize existing paddings/margins to this system so the whole page feels consistent.

⸻

2.2 Typography Scale

Base font: keep the current one (likely Inter or similar), but adjust sizes using this scale:
	•	H1 (main hero title): 48px, semibold
	•	H2 (section titles): 32–36px, semibold
	•	H3 (card titles, FAQ question headings, assistance titles): 22–24px, medium
	•	Body text: 16–18px, regular
	•	Small meta text (badges, sub-labels): 14px

Make sure:
	•	The hero H1 is clearly larger than all other titles.
	•	Section titles (“Comment faire sa demande…”, “Votre demande de raccordement”, “Questions fréquentes”, “Assistance pour votre demande…”) use the same H2 style.
	•	Card titles and FAQ questions are consistent with each other as H3.

Do NOT change the actual wording; only adjust classes / styles.

2.3 Illustrations & Proportions

We have several .webp illustrations in the project. Map and size them as follows (adapt paths to the real locations in /public or assets folder):
	•	Hero illustration: keep the current house + solar + people illustration, but increase its visible width by about 15–20% so it balances the hero text.
	•	Section “Commencez votre demande de raccordement Enedis ici” (just under the hero):
	•	On the left: text
	•	On the right: use the illustration of the woman at a laptop with the form (e.g. Commencez votre demande.webp).
	•	Increase this illustration size so it feels clearly bigger than the icons in the later sections (approx the same visual weight as hero illustrations but slightly smaller).
	•	Assistance section (“Assistance pour votre demande de raccordement Enedis”):
	•	4 cards laid out in a row on desktop, stacked on mobile.
	•	Use these images (names may differ; pick the best match in the repo and wire them correctly):
	1.	“Appelez-nous” → use the phone illustration with headset + laptop (e.g. Appelez-nous.webp).
	2.	“Rappel gratuit” → use the illustration where a person is next to a phone / callback bubble (e.g. Rappel gratuit0.webp).
	3.	“Chat” → use the chat bubbles illustration (e.g. Chat.webp).
	4.	“Formulaire de contact” → use the support agent with “FAQ/form” icon or the person at laptop (e.g. Besoin d'aide.webp or Formulaire de contact.webp).
	•	Make all 4 icons consistent in size (around 120–140px wide) and centered.
	•	FAQ section:
	•	At the top (near “Questions fréquentes”), optionally display the FAQ illustration (e.g. FAQ.webp) aligned to one side on desktop and hidden or centered on mobile.
	•	Keep it subtle so it does not distract from the accordions.

Ensure all illustrations share similar visual weight and are not randomly small or huge.

2.4 Card Styles

For service cards and assistance cards, give them a unified professional card style:
	•	background: #FFFFFF
	•	border-radius: 16px
	•	border: 1px solid rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.06) (subtle)
	•	box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.04)
	•	Internal padding around content: ~32px (or Tailwind p-8)

On hover (desktop only):
	•	Slight raise: transform: translateY(-2px)
	•	Background tint: background-color: #F5F7FF
	•	Transition: transition: all 0.15s ease-out

Apply this style to:
	•	The 6 “Votre demande de raccordement” cards
	•	The 4 “Assistance” cards

Do NOT change the text inside; only styles.

2.5 Section-Specific Changes

Hero section (“Demande de Raccordement Enedis”)
	1.	Keep layout: left text, right illustration.
	2.	Increase hero H1 to 48px equivalent.
	3.	Ensure subtitle and bullet line are not too wide (max 620px width).
	4.	Add subtle visual separation under the hero so the next section doesn’t feel like a second hero:
	•	Either a light bottom border:
border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.06);
	•	Or a very light gradient background for the hero only, e.g.:
background: radial-gradient(circle at 70% 30%, #EEF2FF 0%, #FFFFFF 60%);

Use whichever integrates better with the current code.

“Commencez votre demande de raccordement Enedis ici”
	1.	Ensure this section has ~80px top padding in relation to the hero, not as large as a new hero.
	2.	Use a two-column layout:
	•	Left: text block (max 560–600px width).
	•	Right: the laptop/form illustration, centered vertically.
	3.	Increase the CTA button spacing slightly so it breathes.

4-step process (“Comment faire sa demande de raccordement électrique en ligne ?”)
	1.	Keep the 4 steps but:
	•	Increase each step icon size modestly.
	•	Make numbers (1,2,3,4) consistent size and alignment.
	•	Check vertical alignment of titles and descriptions under icons; they should align visually in a 4-column grid.
	2.	Maintain section padding: ~96px top and bottom, consistent with other sections.

Service cards (“Votre demande de raccordement”)
	1.	Apply the unified card style above.
	2.	Make sure card titles use the H3 style (22–24px) and descriptions use 16px body text.
	3.	At the very top of this section, reduce top padding so it visually follows the process section by about 80px.

FAQ section
	1.	Ensure section title is H2 (32–36px) and centered.
	2.	Add the FAQ illustration as described under 2.3, if it fits nicely with the layout.
	3.	Slightly reduce vertical padding in each accordion item so the list does not feel too tall, but do not hurt readability.

Assistance section
	1.	Ensure section heading “Assistance pour votre demande de raccordement Enedis” uses H2 style.
	2.	Subtitle “Nous sommes à votre écoute…” uses regular 16–18px text.
	3.	Use a responsive grid: 4 cards in a row on desktop, 2x2 on tablet, 1 per row on mobile.
	4.	Apply the unified card style and icon sizing as specified.

CTA + Footer
	1.	Reduce the height of the purple CTA band:
	•	Vertical padding around the text + button: around 56–72px instead of something very tall.
	2.	Keep the copy and button as they are.
	3.	Add a bit of space (e.g. 40px) between CTA band and the footer.
	4.	Make sure typography in the footer is 14–16px and consistent.

⸻

3. Code Hygiene
	•	Keep changes modular: if there is a Home or Landing component, update it and related CSS/utility files rather than sprinkling ad-hoc styles everywhere.
	•	Do not rename components or routes.
	•	Run the project locally (if supported) and ensure no TypeScript or ESLint errors are introduced.

⸻

4. Acceptance Criteria

The task is complete when:
	1.	The landing page visually matches these principles:
	•	Consistent spacing scale between all sections
	•	Clear typography hierarchy (hero H1 > H2 sections > card titles > body)
	•	Illustrations balanced & consistent
	•	Cards visually unified and professional
	•	Hero is clearly separated from the second section (no “double hero” effect)
	2.	No tracking scripts, forms, or API logic have been modified.
	3.	The page still builds and renders correctly with responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Please start by locating the main landing page file and any shared layout/components used for the sections listed above. Then implement all design system and section-specific changes described, keeping logic and tracking untouched.
