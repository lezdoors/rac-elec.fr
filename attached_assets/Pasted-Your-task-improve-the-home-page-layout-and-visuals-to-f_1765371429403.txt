Your task: improve the home page layout and visuals to feel as clean and balanced as the original version, without touching any business logic or forms.

Please work ONLY on the home page layout, CSS and assets. Do not change routing, form behavior, or any backend code.

1. Header logo: use the new brand
	1.	Find the component that renders the main header/navigation (for example Header, Navbar or similar, typically used in App or the main page).
	2.	Replace the current logo with the new logo image I uploaded (the blue house with plug and green lightning). Save it in the project (for example under public/ as service-raccordement-logo.png) and reference that.
	3.	To the right of the logo, create a lockup with a thin vertical separator line:
	•	Left: the logo icon (not too big, around 28–32px tall).
	•	Separator: a 1px vertical line in a light neutral color.
	•	Right: two lines of text:
	•	Line 1 (bolder): Service Raccordement Électricité
	•	Line 2 (smaller, lighter): Expert raccordement Enedis
	4.	Align icon + text vertically so it looks like this:
[icon] | Service Raccordement Électricité
         Expert raccordement Enedis

Follow the existing typography system (same font family). Use something like:
	•	Line 1: semibold, ~16px
	•	Line 2: regular, ~12–13px, slightly lighter color (e.g. gray-500).

Goal: unified, professional brand header like on the old site.

2. Section order on the home page
Re-order the main sections on the home page so the vertical flow is:
	1.	Hero section: main “Demande de Raccordement Enedis” hero with big headline, subtext and primary CTA.
	2.	Directly under the hero:
“Comment Faire sa Demande de Raccordement Électrique en Ligne ?” section with the 4 steps (icons 1–4 and explanation).
	3.	Then: the section with all the raccordement service cards (6 cards: Raccordement Définitif, Provisoire, Viabilisation, etc.).
	4.	Then: “Assistance pour Votre Demande de Raccordement Enedis” (call, rappel gratuit, chat, contact form).
	5.	Then FAQ, then final CTA + footer.

Make sure vertical spacing between sections is consistent and not too big. It should feel similar to the old site: hero → process → services → assistance → FAQ → bottom CTA.

Goal: more natural narrative: understand what we do (hero), how it works (steps), what services exist, how to get help, then FAQ and final CTA.

3. Process section right under hero (visual tweaks)
In the section “Comment Faire sa Demande de Raccordement Électrique en Ligne ?”:
	•	Keep the 4 steps, but slightly increase the illustration size for each step so they are easier to see.
	•	Ensure the section heading and subheading use a clear typographic hierarchy:
	•	Title ~28–32px, bold.
	•	Subtitle ~14–16px, regular, max width so it doesn’t stretch too wide.
	•	Reduce any excessive top margin so this section is visually connected to the hero (not too much white space between them).

Goal: the first scroll should immediately show the process section, not a large empty gap.

4. Service cards & illustrations
In the section with the 6 service cards (Raccordement Définitif, Provisoire, etc.):
	1.	Slightly increase the size of the icons/illustrations at the top of each card. On desktop they can be around 48–56px wide so the cards feel more substantial.
	2.	Keep the same grid layout (2 rows × 3 columns on desktop) but:
	•	Increase vertical padding inside each card a bit.
	•	Make sure the titles are clearly larger than descriptions.
	3.	Confirm hover state is subtle and consistent (e.g., light shadow or slight border color). Reuse existing style if already implemented.

Goal: cards should feel as solid and “clickable” as on the old site, not tiny or lost in white space.

5. Assistance section illustrations (no white squares)
In the “Assistance pour Votre Demande de Raccordement Enedis” section:
	1.	Currently, the assistance options (Appelez-nous, Rappel gratuit, Chat, Formulaire de contact) show the illustrations inside small white squares; the original assets were transparent (no background).
	2.	Update the design so:
	•	The icons/illustrations are used with transparent background (no white rounded box behind them).
	•	Increase icon size slightly so they are more visible.
	•	Keep the card containers clean and minimal (e.g., simple layout: icon above text, or icon left text right) using the existing design language.
	3.	Ensure the background of the whole section remains clean (white or very light gray) so it doesn’t compete with the gradient sections.

Goal: make the assistance icons look like native, modern illustrations instead of tiny stickers inside white boxes.

6. Remove the orange and align with brand colors
	1.	Locate the orange CTA band near the bottom (“Prêt à démarrer votre projet ?”).
	2.	Replace the orange background with a color that fits the brand:
	•	Use the same blue/purple gradient used elsewhere on the site OR a solid brand blue that matches the primary buttons.
	3.	Update the CTA button inside that band:
	•	Use the same primary button style used in the hero (blue button).
	•	Adjust text color for good contrast (white text on dark background).
	4.	Check for any other remaining orange elements on the page (buttons, links, badges) and replace their color with the brand primary or a subtle accent consistent with the rest of the UI.

Goal: consistent blue/green brand palette, no random orange.

7. General spacing & typography polish
Without changing content:
	•	Ensure the max width of main text blocks (hero copy, process description, services description) is around 640–720px so lines don’t become too long on wide screens.
	•	Check vertical rhythm:
	•	Section titles: consistent top margin.
	•	Subtitles: smaller gap to title than to the section content.
	•	Confirm that on mobile:
	•	The hero stack is vertical: title → text → buttons → illustration.
	•	Cards and assistance items stack cleanly with comfortable spacing.

Goal: the page should feel tight, airy, and consistent, like a professional SaaS landing page.
