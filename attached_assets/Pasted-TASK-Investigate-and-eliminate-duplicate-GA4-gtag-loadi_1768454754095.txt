TASK: Investigate and eliminate duplicate GA4/gtag loading (keep GTM as the ONLY loader) without breaking conversions.

Context:
- Site uses GTM container: GTM-K597C4C2.
- PageSpeed shows TWO gtag.js requests:
  1) /gtag/js?id=G-D92SQT9L1P
  2) /gtag/js?id=G-D92SQT9L1P&...&gtm=...
This indicates GA4 is being loaded twice (either once directly in site code + once via GTM, or twice via GTM).

Goal:
- Exactly ONE GTM script on the site.
- GA4 should be configured ONLY through GTM (no direct gtag snippet in the site code).
- Conversions must continue to fire (Google Ads + Microsoft UET + Purchase).

Deliverables:
1) Evidence: show which files/scripts cause each request.
2) Fix: remove/disable the duplicate source.
3) Verification: after fix, confirm only one gtag.js request (or gtag loaded once via GTM) and that GTM preview still shows expected tags firing.

Step-by-step Investigation (MANDATORY):
A) In local dev (or deployed), open DevTools Network and filter for:
   - "gtm.js"
   - "gtag/js"
   Record whether there are 2 gtag/js requests and their initiators (Initiator column).
   Save the initiator stack or note which script tag triggered each.

B) Search the codebase for any direct GA4/gtag install and report findings:
   Search strings:
   - "gtag/js"
   - "G-D92SQT9L1P"
   - "googletagmanager.com/gtag"
   - "window.dataLayer"
   - "function gtag"
   - "GTM-K597C4C2"
   Check typical locations:
   - index.html / public/index.html
   - src/main.tsx / main.jsx
   - any Layout/App shell components
   - any "Analytics", "Tracking", "GTM" utility
   - vercel.json headers/inject scripts if present

C) If no direct gtag snippet exists in code:
   Then duplication is inside GTM config. Investigate tags that can load Google tag:
   - "Google Tag G-D92SQT9L1P"
   - any other "Google Tag" type (e.g., "thank_you_page_view" is Google Tag)
   Identify if more than one "Google Tag" config is firing on All Pages or Initialization.
   Report which one is redundant.

Fix Rules (STRICT):
- Do NOT change business logic, form flow, Stripe, CRM, routes, content, UI.
- Do NOT remove GTM.
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Only remove the duplicate GA4 loader:
  - If found in site code: delete that direct gtag snippet so GA4 is ONLY via GTM.
  - If duplication is in GTM: ensure ONLY ONE Google Tag/GA4 config loads per page.
- Keep Ads conversion tags and UET intact.

Verification (MANDATORY):
1) After changes, reload the site and confirm in Network:
   - One /gtm.js request
   - NO extra /gtag/js duplicate requests (gtag should not be loaded twice)
2) Use GTM Preview mode to confirm these still fire as expected:
   - Page View
   - form_start event
   - form_submit event
   - purchase / thank you event
3) Provide a short summary: what caused duplication + what exactly was changed.
