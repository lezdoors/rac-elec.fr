I need to improve an existing French electrical connection service website (portail-electricite.com) that specializes in Enedis electrical connections. The site is currently profitable but needs technical improvements while maintaining its current design and functionality.

Current Site Overview:

French electrical connection service (raccordement électrique Enedis)
Main services: new home connections, business connections, solar installations
Key conversion elements: phone number (09 70 70 95 70), quote request forms
Target audience: French property owners, businesses, contractors
Current messaging works well - don't change core content or value propositions
Required Improvements:

Mobile Optimization
Make all forms mobile-friendly with proper touch targets (minimum 44px)
Ensure forms work perfectly on phones and tablets
Improve mobile user experience for quote requests
Use proper input types for mobile keyboards (tel, email, numeric)
Performance Enhancement
Optimize images for faster loading
Improve page speed scores
Implement efficient CSS and JavaScript loading
Add lazy loading for images
Form Optimization
Add auto-completion attributes for faster form filling
Include real-time validation with helpful error messages
Add progress indicators for multi-step forms
Improve form accessibility and user experience
Local SEO Structure
Create location-specific landing pages for major French cities (Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Nice, Nantes, Montpellier, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Lille)
Each city page should follow the pattern: /raccordement-electrique-[ville]
Maintain the same service information but localize for each city
SEO Enhancement
Add proper schema markup for local business and services
Implement structured data for better search visibility
Maintain existing content while improving technical SEO
Important Constraints:

Keep the existing design aesthetic and layout
Maintain all current content and messaging
Don't add new features like calculators, chat widgets, or videos
Focus purely on technical improvements and optimization
Ensure the phone number and main CTAs remain prominent
Keep the 4-step process visualization
Preserve customer testimonials section
Success Criteria:

Mobile PageSpeed score above 85
Forms work seamlessly on all devices
Fast loading times across all pages
Improved local search visibility for French cities
Better user experience without changing core functionality
