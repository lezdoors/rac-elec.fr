Audit the tracking/tag configuration currently implemented on demande-raccordement.fr.

Hard rules
	•	Do not modify any code.
	•	Do not change Google Tag Manager, GA4, Google Ads, UET, or any settings.
	•	Do not run migrations, installs, or deploys.
	•	Do not open PRs or commit anything.
	•	Output analysis only.

What I need from you

Provide a neutral, factual inventory of what tracking is currently present in the codebase and how it behaves.

1) Tag/Script Inventory

Identify all tracking-related scripts and integrations currently loaded by the site, including but not limited to:
	•	Google Tag Manager
	•	GA4 / gtag
	•	Google Ads tags
	•	Microsoft UET
	•	Clarity
	•	Any other analytics / pixels / CDP / consent tooling

For each, report:
	•	Where it is injected (file path / component / layout)
	•	The IDs present (container IDs, measurement IDs, etc.)
	•	Whether it appears more than once (duplicate loads)

2) Event Inventory (Data Layer + gtag)

Find and list every place in the code where tracking events are sent, including:
	•	dataLayer.push(...)
	•	gtag(...)
	•	any custom analytics wrappers/helpers

For each event, report:
	•	Event name
	•	File path(s)
	•	What user action or lifecycle triggers it (click, submit, route change, page load, etc.)
	•	Whether it can fire multiple times (and why, based on the code)

3) Form Tracking Behavior

Identify how the form is implemented (including any multi-step logic) and document:
	•	Where step navigation happens
	•	Where submission happens
	•	Whether completion/confirmation triggers any tracking events
	•	What “success” looks like in code (route/page/state/API response)

4) Output Format

Return a structured report:

A) Tracking Systems Detected
(list each system + where loaded + IDs + duplicates)

B) Event Map
(event name → file path → trigger condition → notes on repeat firing)

C) Form Funnel Behavior
(step changes, submit, confirmation, and what is tracked at each point)

D) Risk Flags (observed only)
(duplicates, SPA rerender issues, missing completion event, etc.)

E) Suggested Next Checks (no changes)
(what to verify next, but do not implement anything)
