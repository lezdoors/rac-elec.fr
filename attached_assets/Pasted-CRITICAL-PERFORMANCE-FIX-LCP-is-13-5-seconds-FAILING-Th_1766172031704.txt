CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX - LCP is 13.5 seconds (FAILING):

The Largest Contentful Paint is taking 13.5 seconds on mobile when it should be under 2.5 seconds. This is the #1 reason mobile conversions are zero.

ROOT CAUSES FROM PAGESPEED:
1. LCP request discovery is delayed
2. Images are not optimized
3. Render-blocking resources

FIX REQUIRED:

1. IDENTIFY THE LCP ELEMENT:
   - It's likely the hero section heading "Demande de Raccordement Enedis" or the hero illustration
   - Find the largest visible element in the viewport on page load

2. IF IT'S TEXT (the heading):
   - Ensure the font is preloaded: <link rel="preload" href="font-url" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
   - Use font-display: swap in @font-face rules
   - Consider using system fonts for hero text

3. IF IT'S AN IMAGE (the illustration):
   - Add fetchpriority="high" to the hero image
   - Ensure the image is not lazy-loaded (remove loading="lazy" if present)
   - Preload the hero image: <link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero-image-url">
   - Compress the image to WebP format, max 100KB file size
   - Serve properly sized image (max 800px width for mobile)

4. REMOVE RENDER-BLOCKING RESOURCES:
   - Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
   - Defer non-critical CSS: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
   - Move non-critical JavaScript to end of body with defer attribute

5. ADD EXPLICIT DIMENSIONS:
   - Add width and height attributes to the hero image to prevent layout shift
   - Example: <img src="hero.png" width="800" height="600" alt="...">

VERIFY: After implementing, the LCP should drop from 13.5s to under 2.5s.
Prompt #2: Fix First Contentful Paint (FCP)

CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX - FCP is 6.4 seconds (FAILING):

First Contentful Paint at 6.4 seconds means users see a blank white screen for over 6 seconds. On mobile, users abandon after 3 seconds.

FIX REQUIRED:

1. ELIMINATE RENDER-BLOCKING RESOURCES:
   - Identify all CSS files loaded in <head>
   - Inline critical CSS (CSS needed for above-the-fold content) directly in <head> using <style> tags
   - Load non-critical CSS asynchronously:
     <link rel="preload" href="styles.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
     <noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"></noscript>

2. OPTIMIZE JAVASCRIPT LOADING:
   - Move all <script> tags to end of <body>
   - Add defer attribute to scripts: <script src="app.js" defer></script>
   - If using external analytics/tracking, load them asynchronously

3. REDUCE SERVER RESPONSE TIME:
   - Ensure Replit deployment is not "sleeping" (use a paid plan if needed)
   - Check if there's server-side rendering causing delays
   - Consider adding a simple loading state/skeleton screen

4. OPTIMIZE WEB FONTS:
   - Preload critical fonts
   - Use font-display: swap or font-display: optional
   - Consider using system font stack for instant rendering:
     font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif;

5. MINIMIZE HTML SIZE:
   - Remove unnecessary comments
   - Minify HTML
   - Remove unused inline styles

VERIFY: FCP should drop from 6.4s to under 1.8s.
Prompt #3: Fix Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

PERFORMANCE FIX - CLS is 0.161 (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT):

Cumulative Layout Shift of 0.161 means elements are moving around during page load, creating a janky experience. This hurts mobile conversions.

FIX REQUIRED:

1. ADD EXPLICIT DIMENSIONS TO ALL IMAGES:
   - Find every <img> tag
   - Add width and height attributes that match the image's aspect ratio
   - Example: <img src="hero.png" width="800" height="600" alt="...">
   - This reserves space before the image loads

2. RESERVE SPACE FOR DYNAMIC CONTENT:
   - If you have skeleton loaders or placeholders, ensure they match final content size
   - Use aspect-ratio CSS property: aspect-ratio: 16/9;

3. AVOID INSERTING CONTENT ABOVE EXISTING CONTENT:
   - Don't inject ads, banners, or notifications above the fold after page load
   - If you must, reserve space for them

4. PRELOAD FONTS:
   - Web fonts loading late can cause text to shift
   - Preload critical fonts: <link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
   - Use font-display: optional to prevent invisible text phase

5. FIX FORCED REFLOW (mentioned in diagnostics):
   - Avoid reading layout properties (offsetHeight, scrollTop) then immediately writing styles
   - Batch DOM reads and writes separately

VERIFY: CLS should drop from 0.161 to under 0.1.
Prompt #4: Eliminate Unused JavaScript (436 KB)

PERFORMANCE FIX - 436 KB of unused JavaScript is slowing mobile:

You're shipping 436 KB of JavaScript that's not being used. On mobile networks, this takes 2-3 extra seconds to download and parse.

FIX REQUIRED:

1. IDENTIFY THE BLOAT:
   - Check if you're importing entire libraries when you only need small parts
   - Example: If using lodash, import specific functions instead of the whole library
   - Bad: import _ from 'lodash'
   - Good: import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'

2. REMOVE UNUSED DEPENDENCIES:
   - Check package.json for libraries you're not actually using
   - Remove them: npm uninstall [package-name]

3. CODE SPLIT:
   - If you have route-based components, split JavaScript by route
   - Only load JavaScript needed for the current page
   - Use dynamic imports: const Component = () => import('./Component')

4. TREE SHAKING:
   - Ensure your build tool (Vite/Webpack) is configured for tree shaking
   - Use ES6 modules (import/export) not CommonJS (require)
   - Check build config for optimization settings

5. DEFER NON-CRITICAL JS:
   - Move analytics, chat widgets, social media embeds to load after page interactive
   - Use Intersection Observer to load features only when needed

VERIFY: JavaScript bundle size should drop by at least 200-300 KB.
Prompt #5: Fix Inefficient Cache Lifetimes (230 KB)

PERFORMANCE FIX - 230 KB of resources have poor caching:

Static assets (CSS, JS, images) are being re-downloaded on every visit instead of cached. This destroys repeat visitor experience.

FIX REQUIRED:

1. CHECK REPLIT DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS:
   - Verify if Replit is serving static assets with proper cache headers
   - Static assets should have cache-control headers set

2. ADD CACHE HEADERS (if you have control):
   - For images, CSS, JS: Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
   - For HTML: Cache-Control: no-cache (must revalidate)

3. USE CONTENT HASHING:
   - Ensure your build tool adds hashes to filenames
   - Example: app.abc123.js instead of app.js
   - This enables aggressive caching without staleness issues

4. OPTIMIZE IMAGES FOR CACHING:
   - Compress images (use TinyPNG or similar)
   - Convert to WebP format
   - Serve properly sized images (don't send 2000px image when you need 400px)

5. IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL HEADERS:
   - Consider using a CDN like Cloudflare (free plan) in front of Replit
   - This will add proper caching automatically

VERIFY: Repeat page loads should be 2-3x faster. PERFORMANCE FIX - Images are optimized but improperly delivered:

The images are already compressed to WebP format, but PageSpeed still shows 131 KB of potential savings. This means the DELIVERY is wrong, not the compression.

FIX REQUIRED:

1. ADD EXPLICIT DIMENSIONS TO PREVENT LAYOUT SHIFT:
   - Find every <img> tag in the HTML
   - Add width and height attributes matching the actual image dimensions
   - Example: <img src="hero.webp" width="800" height="600" alt="...">
   - This is CRITICAL for fixing the 0.161 CLS score

2. FIX HERO IMAGE LOADING PRIORITY:
   - The hero illustration should NOT have loading="lazy"
   - Add fetchpriority="high" to the hero image:
     <img src="hero.webp" fetchpriority="high" width="800" height="600" alt="...">
   - This tells the browser to load it immediately

3. PRELOAD THE HERO IMAGE:
   - Add to <head> section:
     <link rel="preload" as="image" href="/path/to/hero.webp" fetchpriority="high">
   - This starts downloading the hero image BEFORE the HTML is fully parsed

4. USE RESPONSIVE IMAGES FOR MOBILE:
   - Even though images are WebP, you might be serving full-size to mobile
   - Create mobile-optimized versions (400px width)
   - Use srcset:
   ```html
   <img src="hero-800.webp" 
        srcset="hero-400.webp 400w, hero-800.webp 800w"
        sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 800px"
        width="800" height="600"
        fetchpriority="high"
        alt="Demande de Raccordement Enedis">
