🚨 URGENT PERFORMANCE & DEPLOYMENT FIX - BEAT COMPETITION 🚨

We're losing money to competitors because of poor site performance. PageSpeed shows 64/100 - this is killing conversions. Fix ALL issues:

IMMEDIATE CRITICAL FIXES:

1. VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX:
- Add vercel.json with SPA routing:
{
  "rewrites": [{"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"}],
  "headers": [{
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "headers": [
      {"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"},
      {"key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff"}
    ]
  }]
}

2. FIX /enedis-raccordement ROUTE:
- Ensure React Router route exists
- Test route works locally before deploy
- Fix CTA buttons to redirect (not scroll)

3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (CRITICAL):

LAZY LOAD EVERYTHING:
- Lazy load Stripe (only load on payment page)
- Lazy load Google Fonts with font-display: swap
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use React.lazy() for heavy components

CODE SPLITTING:
- Split JavaScript bundles
- Remove unused dependencies
- Tree-shake all imports
- Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries

RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION:

- No demo content
- 100% professional appearance

5. ADD PROFESSIONAL TRUST ELEMENTS:
- Add LogoLoop component: npx shadcn@latest add https://reactbits.dev/r/LogoLoop-JS-CSS
- Professional badges (avoid "Partenaire Enedis" - we have no agreement)
- Use: "Service Indépendant", "Expert Certifié", "25,000+ Dossiers Traités"
- Add professional testimonials
- Security badges

6. ACCESSIBILITY FIXES:
