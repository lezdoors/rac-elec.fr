We are seeing measurement integrity issues inside Google Tag Manager, not in the application logic.

What is broken (confirmed in GTM Preview)
	1.	Event lifecycle is not clean inside GTM
	•	GTM Preview shows multiple form_start and form_submit events for a single user journey.
	•	Corresponding Google Ads tags (AW – Form_Start, AW – Form_Submit) show “Fired X times” in Preview.
	•	This means GTM is processing the same logical user action more than once.
	2.	Triggers are too permissive
	•	Current Custom Event triggers are firing whenever the event name appears, without sufficient conditions to ensure:
	•	once per session
	•	once per submission
	•	As a result, GTM treats step navigation / repeated events as new conversions.
	3.	Tag Assistant debug overlay is degraded
	•	Browser console shows CSP blocking:
	•	googletagmanager.com/debug/badge.css
	•	This causes the Tag Assistant mini overlay to render in a broken state.
	•	While this is mostly visual, it confirms GTM debug resources are partially blocked and makes diagnosis harder.
	4.	Microsoft / Clarity tags failing confirms CSP + GTM noise
	•	CSP blocks bat.bing.com and clarity.ms.
	•	These failures are not the Google Ads issue, but they confirm GTM is operating in a constrained / noisy environment.

Why this matters
	•	Google Ads optimization relies on clean, singular conversion signals.
	•	When GTM fires conversion tags multiple times for one logical action, Smart Bidding learns from polluted data.
	•	This directly affects CPA, learning stability, and scaling decisions.

What needs to be fixed in GTM (outcome-based)
	1.	Tighten triggers
	•	Ensure form_start and form_submit triggers fire only under strict conditions that represent the true lifecycle event.
	•	They must not fire repeatedly for the same session or same submission.
	2.	Ensure one-to-one mapping
	•	One user action → one GTM event → one Google Ads conversion fire.
	•	No duplicates visible in GTM Preview timeline.
	3.	Restore clean GTM Preview behavior
	•	Once triggers are corrected, GTM Preview should show:
	•	exactly one form_start
	•	exactly one form_submit
	•	clean tag firing counts (no “Fired 3 times”)

Acceptance criteria

In GTM Preview, for a single complete form journey:
	•	form_start appears once
	•	form_submit appears once
	•	Corresponding Google Ads tags fire once
	•	No repeated conversion events when navigating steps

Once this is fixed, we can correctly track the funnel and make informed Google Ads optimization decisions.
