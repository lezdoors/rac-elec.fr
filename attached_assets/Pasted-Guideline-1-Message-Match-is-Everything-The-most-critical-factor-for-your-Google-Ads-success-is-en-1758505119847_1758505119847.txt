Guideline 1: Message Match is Everything

The most critical factor for your Google Ads success is ensuring a seamless, logical flow from your ad to your landing page. If a user feels they've landed on the wrong page, even for a second, you've already lost.

    Make Your Headline a Mirror: The main headline (<h1>) on your landing page must be a direct continuation of your ad copy. If your ad says "Devis gratuit pour raccordement électrique," your page's H1 should say exactly that.

    Deliver on the Promise: If your ad promises a quote, the very first thing the user sees should be the quote form. Don't make them scroll or click another button to find it. This eliminates the "dead-end" penalty.

    Keep the Language Consistent: Use the same keywords and phrases from your ad throughout the top of your landing page to reinforce relevance.

Guideline 2: Eliminate All Friction

Google's new algorithms are designed to reward speed and ease of use, especially on mobile devices. Every extra second or unnecessary click hurts your Quality Score.

    One Page, One Goal: Your landing page should have a single purpose: to get a lead. Remove all links that lead away from the page, including social media icons and unnecessary navigation links.

    Put the Form Front and Center: The lead form should be on the same page and clearly visible. Don't hide it behind a button that redirects to a new page. Use an anchor link that smoothly scrolls the user down to the form.

    Optimize for Speed: The page must load incredibly fast. Use tools like Google's [PageSpeed Insights] to check your performance. Minimize image sizes and use modern image formats.

Guideline 3: Build Trust and Authority

For a high-priced service like an electrical connection, trust is everything. Your landing page needs to quickly establish credibility.

    Add Your Phone Number: A clear, clickable phone number in the header is a powerful trust signal. It shows you're a real business and gives users a quick, alternative way to contact you.

    Show Proof: Include testimonials, logos of trusted partners (like Enedis), or performance indicators that validate your expertise. This reassures the user that they can trust you with their project.

    Be Transparent: Your footer should contain essential information like links to your legal notices ("Mentions légales") and privacy policy. This signals to both users and Google that you are a legitimate business.

By following these three guidelines, you will fundamentally transform how your landing pages are perceived by Google and, more importantly, by your potential customers.
