We already have a working chatbot in another Replit project named elec-vercel-raccordement.
I want to reuse the exact same chatbot (same UI, same backend logic) in this project:
rac-elec.fr, which is the production site for www.demande-raccordement.fr.

This is a copy/reuse task, not a redesign.

⸻

Rules (critical)
	1.	Do not redesign, refactor, or optimize anything.
	2.	Only copy what is strictly required for the chatbot to work.
	3.	Do not modify any existing form, CRM, or routing logic.
	4.	If something is missing (API route, env var), add it without touching unrelated code.
	5.	If reuse is not possible, explain exactly why (technical limitation).

⸻

Step 1 — Identify chatbot architecture in elec-vercel-raccordement

Please identify and document clearly:
	•	Chat UI component:
	•	File path
	•	How it is mounted in the UI
	•	Backend chat logic:
	•	API route path (example: /api/chat)
	•	File path
	•	Whether it uses:
	•	Vercel AI SDK
	•	Direct OpenAI calls
	•	Another provider
	•	Required environment variables:
	•	Variable names only (no values)
	•	Any auth, middleware, or rate limiting involved

⸻

Step 2 — Replit chatbot capability check

Before copying anything, confirm:
	•	Does Replit provide a “preferred/default chatbot” setting for websites?
	•	If yes:
	•	Can we configure the project to use an existing chatbot implementation?
	•	If no:
	•	Confirm that manual reuse (copying UI + API route) is the correct approach

Be explicit — no assumptions.

⸻

Step 3 — Compatibility check with rac-elec.fr

Confirm for this project:
	•	Framework used (Next.js / Vite / Express / other)
	•	Whether API routes are supported in the same way
	•	Whether an existing chatbot already exists (partial or unused)

⸻

Step 4 — Implement chatbot reuse in rac-elec.fr

If compatible:
	•	Copy the chatbot UI component exactly as-is
	•	Copy or recreate the backend route using the same structure
	•	Add required environment variables (names only)
	•	Mount the chatbot on www.demande-raccordement.fr in the same location as the working project

⸻

Step 5 — Validation checklist

Confirm:
	•	Chat widget renders correctly
	•	Messages send and receive successfully
	•	No console or server errors
	•	No conflicts with existing routes
	•	Works on mobile

⸻

Final Deliverables

Provide:
	1.	List of files added or modified
	2.	Required environment variable names
	3.	Chat API endpoint URL
	4.	Confirmation whether Replit supports a preferred/default chatbot or not
